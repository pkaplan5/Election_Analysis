2. Get a list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage each candidate received.
5. Determine the election winner.

Overview of Election Audit: 

My task for the election audit was to determine the total votes cast, the votes casted by county and their percentage of the total, the vote amount per candidate with percentage of the total election amount, and the winner of the election with vote amount.


Election-Audit Results: 

369,711 votes were cast in the general election.

By county the votes were Jefferson with 10.5% votes casted of the total election votes with 38,855 votes, Denver with 82.8% votes casted of the total election votes with 06,055 votes, Arapahoe with 6.7% votes casted of the total election votes with 24,801 votes in the election.

The largest turn-out was with Denver county with 82.8% of the votes casted of the election.

The candidate results were:

*Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes. <P></P>
*Diana DeGette: 73.8% of the vote and 272,892. <P></P>
*Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes. <P></P>

This scriopt can be used for numerous projects in the future. It can definitely be re-purposed for other elections going forward but also for any project where items need to be tabulated and determined what percentage they accounted for of the whole amount measured. If the Colorado government would like to know how many people got their vaccination by county it can be used for this purpose. The totals by county can be provided with descriptive statistics.

I had some difficulty with vs code during my work on this assignment. My software was acting erractily and I had to reisntall all of vs code and the python extension. After doing that I had no difficulty with this assignment.
